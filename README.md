# hw_18_tableau-

For my analysis of Citibike, I looked at the 2022 data provided on their website, and due to the files being seperated by months I first had to clean and merge the csv's into one large file. After that I started working on the Tableau and looked at what the data provided. Looking at popular times to ride, the distances people on average ride, and comparing to the map the purpose of the analysis was to be able to observe the highest amount of bikers in a particular area. The highest amount of riders out for most days would be around 5pm and 6pm and looking at the avergage distance riden for riders would be 1.2 miles, and comparing to the map and the larger and darker dots we can conclude that those areas would has the highest bike traffic within a mile from there at 5pm.
